# ML-MarchMadness-Mania

## Project Description

ML-MarchMadness-Mania is a project focused on participating in the annual Kaggle competition known as "March Machine Learning Mania." In this competition, individuals from around the world compete to predict the outcomes of the NCAA Basketball March Madness tournaments for both Men and Women.

### Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to develop machine learning models and predictive algorithms that can accurately forecast the results of the NCAA Basketball March Madness tournaments. By doing so, we aim to showcase the power of data science and machine learning in predicting sports outcomes.

## Acknowledgments

My sincere gratitude to the following:

- **Kaggle:** I thank Kaggle for hosting the "March Machine Learning Mania" competition and providing the datasets essential for this project.

- **Kaggle Community:** Special thanks to [mention specific Kaggle users or groups if applicable] for their contributions, code sharing, and support. Their openness to sharing knowledge has been invaluable to our learning journey.

This project marks the beginning of my journey into computer science, inspired by the incredible possibilities showcased in the Kaggle community. I'm delighted to have had the opportunity to participate in this competition and explore the fascinating world of data science and machine learning.

## Future Work

* **Increased Training Data:**
  - The current model utilizes tournament matchups from 2010-2023 for training data. While acknowledging the differences between tournament and regular season games, the goal is to enhance the model's performance by incorporating a broader range of matchups.

* **Additional Features:**
  - Explore the inclusion of ranks in offensive and defensive stats in comparison to other teams. This addition aims to provide the model with more nuanced information for better predictions.
  - Incorporate additional analytics to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the differences between teams.

* **Separation of Men's and Women's Leagues:**
  - Consider exploring the impact of separating data between Men's and Women's basketball leagues during the training and testing process. This separation might reveal insights into potential differences in playing styles, leading to more refined model predictions.
  - Conduct further research on the subject. My hypothesis suggests that the fundamentals of basketball remain consistent across genders. However, additional testing is required to validate this assumption.
