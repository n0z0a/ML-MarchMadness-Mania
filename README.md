# ML-MarchMadness-Mania

## Project Description

ML-MarchMadness-Mania is a project focused on participating in the annual Kaggle competition known as "March Machine Learning Mania." In this competition, individuals from around the world compete to predict the outcomes of the NCAA Basketball March Madness tournaments for both Men and Women.

### Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to develop machine learning models and predictive algorithms that can accurately forecast the results of the NCAA Basketball March Madness tournaments. By doing so, we aim to showcase the power of data science and machine learning in predicting sports outcomes.
